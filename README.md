# Gmail Scripts

Using Google Apps Script to automatically  
- Archive threads marked "read"
- Mark "read" threads I archive without reading
- Mark "read" threads I trash without reading
- Delete spam daily rather than every 30 days, which is probably risky (maybe I'll miss something?) but :shrugging_guy:

Gmail has way more automation available via Google Apps Script - [check out the documentation](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/gmail/) to find out more.
